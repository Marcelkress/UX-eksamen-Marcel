This paper explores players experience of difficulty in video games. Through semi-structured interviews and traditional coding, four themes emerged: the enjoyment of overcoming challenges, frustration stemming from a lack of control, motivation coming from progression, and a preference for fixed difficulty settings. Based on the interviews with four participants, the findings highlight the ambiguous perception of difficulty among experienced players. While acknowledging the limitations and biases of the small sample size, this research offers considerations for game developers. The study suggests possibilities for future research includes larger and more diverse participant groups and focus group interview methodologies.
